# fall-detection

This repo is the new home of the fall detection model used in Ambianic Edge. We are preparing to move the code over from the [ambianic-edge repo](https://github.com/ambianic/ambianic-edge/blob/master/src/ambianic/pipeline/ai/fall_detect.py) and make it available as a standalone library.

Python ML library for people fall detection based on Tensorflow and [PoseNet 2.0](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/posenet).

Includes:
* Python source code and wheel package published on PyPi 
* CI & test suite
* Training and testing data sets
* Third party ML models used as building blocks
